# heroclix-roll20-assets
A collection of assets for playing on Roll20 during this time when we can't play in person

These are largely assets using a template designed by Cory of the Eaglecast [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/eaglesofheroclix) and [discussion group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/eaglesofheroclix/), with some contributions (largely some hcmaps encoding and ephemera) from Bryan. The one instance where this is not true is the case of bystanders, in which case we prefer to use the work of [Don't Punch Bears Heroclix Art](https://www.facebook.com/dontpunchbearsheroclix/) We are working to have everything post July rotation available and may backfill as we go for Bronze/Silver age events.
